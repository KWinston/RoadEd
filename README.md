RoadEd
===========

RoadEd is an MVC-based, Swing application developed in Java to plot the locations of incidents reports gathered by the 311 Explorer data for Edmonton.
Using Google's GSON, we extracted the data we required from the 311 Explorer data that is publicly available on the City of Edmonton website.
After the data is loaded, we decided to use the JXMapKit to plot our points on a map and to use jfreechart to display chart information graphically.

Purpose: An exercise to learn and apply Java programming along with an MVC framework, Swing, threads, and other OOP strategies.
